## 🧭 Game Overview

**MORSE** is a minimalist yet highly creative strategy game inspired by WWI telegraph communication systems. You'll use just two buttons—simulating Morse code dots and dashes—to send artillery commands and repel the German fleet's midnight assault.

* 🎯 **Platform**: HTML5 / Steam
* 🎮 **Controls**: Keyboard, mouse, gamepad, Steam Deck compatible
* 👥 **Supports cooperative play**
* 🕹️ **Special Feature**: Supports custom USB telegraph controllers (including modified nail clippers!)

## 🕹️ Controls

| Function | Key |
| -------- | --- |
| Input Morse Code | Click / Hold |
| Confirm Letter / Fire Artillery | Second button (or Spacebar) |
| View Help Sheet | Right-side reference table (shows letter-to-code mappings) |

> ⚠️ Recommended to start with basic characters like `E (.)`, `T (-)`, `A (.-)`, then gradually master more letters.

## 📦 Core Gameplay: Battlefield Control + Code Input

You'll input letter coordinates (like "E4") on a letter-based coordinate grid to fire artillery shells at enemy ships.

### 🔍 Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Identify target position**: Enemy ships are hidden under certain letter coordinates;
2. **Spell target coordinates using Morse code** (e.g., E → `.`, 4 → `....`);
3. **Fire artillery**: If hit, illuminates surrounding area and deals damage;
4. **Ammunition auto-replenishes**, but at limited frequency—use conservatively.

## 🔥 Tactical Essentials

### 🌘 Revealing Enemies in Darkness

* Initial enemy ships are "hidden" in darkness;
* **First artillery strike** briefly illuminates surrounding area;
* Hitting ship "center" permanently reveals and deals maximum damage.

### 🚢 Enemy Attack Patterns

* Each wave begins with new **isogram words** (like "QUIVER") filling vertical columns;
* Enemy count and types increase with each wave, steadily raising difficulty.

### 💣 Mine System

* Deploy sea mines to block enemy ships;
* Upgrades provide:
  * Timed detonators
  * Damage resistance
  * Early warning system (advance enemy detection)

---

## 🧰 Upgrades & Builds

After repelling each wave, choose one of two upgrade options:

* 🔺 **Artillery Upgrades**: Unlock more powerful shell types (like multi-burst explosions)
* 🔍 **Reconnaissance Enhancement**: Improve vision and detection capabilities
* 💣 **Mine Fortification**: Higher durability and larger range

> Community feedback suggests players want "depth charges" or "triple-shot" artillery—potentially coming in future updates.

## 🔧 Additional Features & Tips

* 🔄 **Cooperative Mode**: Split input buttons for authentic collaborative communication;
* 🎛️ **Adjustable code sensitivity** in settings (cooldown time, recognition speed);
* 🧠 **DIY Telegraph Controller Support**: Vintage keyboard + naval headphones style for maximum immersion.

## 🏁 Survival Objective: Last Until Dawn!

As each enemy wave advances, you must manage:

* Ammunition count
* Code input precision
* Target prioritization
* Map control rhythm

Only precise coding + efficient resource management will hold the line through the final hour.
